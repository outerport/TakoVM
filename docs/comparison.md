### 3. Isolation Technology

**Tako VM:**
- **Docker containers** with aggressive security:
  - `--network=none` by default
  - `--read-only` filesystem
  - `--cap-drop=ALL`
  - `--security-opt=no-new-privileges`
  - Seccomp filtering
  - Non-root execution (uid 1000 via gosu)
  - Resource limits (memory, CPU, PIDs, file size)

**E2B:**
- **Firecracker microVMs** (same tech as AWS Lambda)
- VM-level isolation (stronger than containers)
- <200ms startup with no cold starts
- Hardware-level security boundary

**Daytona:**

### 5. Network Control

**Tako VM:**
- **Granular control per job type:**
